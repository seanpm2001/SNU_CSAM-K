SNU CSAM K

SNUs implementation of a Child Sexual Abuse Material detection, quarantine, reporting, and removal tool.
The K stands for Kid, and is only there to differentiate from other CSAM implementatiomns.

The CSAM K implementation bundles an evidence locker, as machines aren't perfect, and can make mistakes.
With an evidence locker, potential media can be peer reviewed by law enforcement to make sure no mistakes were made.
Whether a mistake is made or not, the evidence locker contents can be used in court as evidence.
